Need to figure out heuristic (or other AI technique).
Estimated turns left. 
Turns spent so far. (or maybe 1 - estimated turns left).
Minimum turns required to end.
Expected money from hand.
Percentage of victory cards.
Action cards unable to be played.
Expected number of buys.
Treasure cards in deck (of each type).
Expected value of next x cards.
Expected value of decks (discard, draw, hand)
Expected value of enemy deck.
UI? 
Highest expected value of a card costing x (for feast and remodel)
Total number of cards coting 5 left from community (for feast)
Increased expected value of buy with 3 additional gold (Moneylender).
Number of curses remaining to give.
Relative number of witches other players are expected to draw.
How am I doing relative to other player in terms of vicoty points (one for loser, one for winner)

Might need a buy vector and a play vector.

Think about what the cards vector should total to. One? Cost? Less valued Cost?

Need more testing on the actual game itself. One of us should play through a full game.

Writeup?
Ask professor on Tuesday. 

Things to work on (priority):
UI hookup.
AI heuristics system. (do the skeleton. like now).
Logging (probably).
Writeup.
